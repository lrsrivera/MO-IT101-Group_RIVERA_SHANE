##To Import Data

Option 1.(Recommended) Inside the extracted file locate the Employee_Details/Attendance folder to access the files. Import the MotorPH Employee Data.xlsx for Emloyee details and Attendance.xlsx for attendance record

Option 2.) For employee Details: You can import the database from the website https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189fvPCZS7JKMBYos00ZEoApqnBB05jAjy2vak6lD4g0/copy and download it as .xlsx file

For the Attendance Record you must download the database without the employee details. I have a existing file on MotorPH_Payroll>Attendance>Attendance.xlsx or you can just download this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kx5ym73lv7z3tLfddxjZFWOGCzpW0uF180ybw_AgHU4/edit?usp=sharing
